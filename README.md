frontend:

use npm to install pnpm

pnpm install

server:

open in IntelliJ - it should happen the build dependencies itself

make a directory under resources called "files"

and then another one inside files "defaults"

This is for our default books path in our BookInitService:"src/main/resources/files/defaults"
Inside defaults you can add some epubs, these will automatically be loaded

I used this website for getting epubs: https://www.gutenberg.org/

This was one of the books I used: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11 - FORMAT: EPUB(any should work)
