</p>


Librium is a performance-focused web application for uploading, managing, and reading your personal ebook library online. Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) primarily for EPUBs, it delivers a fast and seamless reading experience directly in your browser, accessible from anywhere.

The project consists of:
*   **Frontend:** A React application (built with Vite + TypeScript) providing the user interface.
*   **Backend:** A Spring Boot application handling user authentication, book processing, storage management, and API endpoints.

## ‚ú® Features (Current State)

Even in its early stage, Librium offers several core functionalities:

*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies.
*   **EPUB Upload & Processing:** Upload your `.epub` files to your personal library. The backend parses metadata (title, author, ToC) and cover images.
*   **Library Management:**
    *   View your uploaded books with cover images (if available), titles, and authors.
    *   Download your original EPUB files.
    *   Delete books from your library.
*   **Web Reader:**
    *   Read EPUB content directly in the browser.
    *   Navigate between chapters using Next/Previous controls or the Table of Contents drawer.
    *   Basic keyboard navigation (left/right arrows).
*   **Progress Syncing:** Automatically saves and resumes your reading progress at the last visited chapter for each book.
*   **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark themes for the interface.

## üöÄ Future Plans & Roadmap (High-Level)

This project is evolving. Some key areas planned for future development include:

*   **Enhanced Reader Experience:** Font customization, line spacing/margins, scroll position saving, in-book search, progress indicators.
*   **Improved Library Management:** Sorting, filtering, searching, collections/tagging.
*   **Performance & Scalability:** Caching (e.g., Redis), optimizing EPUB parsing/storage.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Intuitive controls, responsiveness, error/loading states.
*   **More Robust EPUB Parsing:** Enhancing the EPUB parser for better compatibility and metadata extraction (potentially leveraging or adapting existing libraries).
*   **Broader Format Support:** Investigating support for `.txt` and potentially others.
*   **External Source Integration:** Exploring integration with sources like Project Gutenberg, Standard Ebooks, etc., for direct browsing and downloading.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** Providing streamlined Docker configurations for easier self-hosting.
*   **Stability & Robustness:** Comprehensive error handling, increased test coverage.
*   **Accessibility:** Auditing and improvements.
